This was a college project which was also the **introduction to Spring Boot**.  
The _config_ package was provided along wtih a few examples of:  
  1) how to write code by using Spring Boot annotations  
  2) the login and register .html files that later were improved slightly  
  
The rest was developed by our team of 3:  
* Apollonas Petros Kallipolitis  
* Nikolaos Pittas  
* Georgios Mithis  
  
In order to execute the program:  
* changes need to be made (most likely) in the application.properties file in order to set it up wtih mysql properly  
* run the src\main\java\myy803\social_book_store\SocialbookstoreApplication.java file
