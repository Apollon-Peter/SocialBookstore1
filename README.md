This was a college project which was also the **introduction to Spring Boot**.  
The _config_ package was provided along wtih a few examples of:  
  1) how to write code by using Spring Boot annotations  
  2) the login and register .html files that later were improved slightly  
  
The rest was developed by our team of 3.
